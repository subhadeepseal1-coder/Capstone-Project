CRICKET WIN PREDICTION
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict outcomes of cricket matches involving the Indian team using historical match data. The goal is to ensure predictive accuracy and provide actionable strategies for upcoming matches against England, Australia, and Sri Lanka. By analyzing key match variables such as venue, opposition, weather, and match format-unique, data-driven recommendations are made to convert predicted losses into wins. Strategy customization is emphasized to counter evolving opponent tactics while maintaining feasibility & match context relevance.
