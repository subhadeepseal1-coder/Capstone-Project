# Capstone-Project
CRICKET WIN PREDICTION
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict outcomes of cricket matches involving the Indian team using historical match data. The goal is to ensure predictive accuracy and provide actionable strategies for upcoming matches against England, Australia, and Sri Lanka. By analyzing key match variables such as venue, opposition, weather, and match format-unique, data-driven recommendations are made to convert predicted losses into wins. Strategy customization is emphasized to counter evolving opponent tactics while maintaining feasibility & match context relevance.

Skills & Tools Covered:
Logistic Regression
Python
Random Forest
Machine Learning
Exploratory Data Analysis
My Learnings:
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world sports analytics. I learned how to perform detailed exploratory data analysis, preprocess complex datasets, and build predictive models tailored to match formats and conditions. Additionally, I developed skills in interpreting model outputs to derive actionable insights and create adaptive strategies. The project enhanced my understanding of cricket dynamics, data-driven decision-making, and the importance of strategic flexibility to outsmart opponents in changing match scenarios.
